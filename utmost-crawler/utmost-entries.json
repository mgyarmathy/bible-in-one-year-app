It is absolute and irrevocable surrender of the will at that point. An undue amount of thought and consideration for ourselves is what keeps us from making that decision, although we cover it up with the pretense that it is others we are considering. When we think seriously about what it will cost others if we obey the call of Jesus, we tell God He doesn&#x2019;t know what our obedience will mean. Keep to the point&#x2014; He does know.

Paul was determined that nothing would stop him from doing exactly what God wanted. But before we choose to follow God&#x2019;s will, a crisis must develop in our lives. This happens because we tend to be unresponsive to God&#x2019;s gentler nudges. He brings us to the place where He asks us to be our utmost for Him and we begin to debate. He then providentially produces a crisis where we have to decide&#x2014; for or against. That moment becomes a great crossroads in our lives.

You will know that the Spirit of God is completely unhindered in that person&#x2019;s life.</p>\n<p>When we are born again by the Spirit of God, our testimony is based solely on what God has done for us, and rightly so.

No one is able to take this stand for Jesus Christ who is not totally compelled by the majesty of His power. It is the only thing that matters, and yet it is strange that it&#x2019;s the last thing we as Christian workers realize. Paul said that he was gripped by the love of God and that is why he acted as he did. People could perceive him as mad or sane&#x2014; he did not care. There was only one thing he lived for&#x2014; to persuade people of the coming judgment of God and to tell them of &#x201C;the love of Christ.&#x201D; This total surrender to &#x201C;the love of Christ&#x201D; is the only thing that will bear fruit in your life.

Whenever we insist that God should give us an answer to prayer we are off track. The purpose of prayer is that we get ahold of God, not of the answer.

Paul&#x2019;s idea of service was to pour his life out to the last drop for others. And whether he received praise or blame made no difference. As long as there was one human being who did not know Jesus, Paul felt a debt of service to that person until he did come to know Him. But the chief motivation behind Paul&#x2019;s service was not love for others but love for his Lord. If our devotion is to the cause of humanity, we will be quickly defeated and broken-hearted, since we will often be confronted with a great deal of ingratitude from other people. But if we are motivated by our love for God, no amount of ingratitude will be able to hinder us from serving one another.</p>\n<p>Paul&#x2019;s understanding of how Christ had dealt with him is the secret behind his determination to serve others. &#x201C;I was formerly a blasphemer, a persecutor, and an insolent man&#x2026;&#x201D; (<a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outgoing/www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Timothy+1:13&apos;);\" href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Timothy+1:13\">1 Timothy 1:13</a>).

Suppose that you have a deep &#x201C;well&#x201D; of hurt and trouble inside your heart, and Jesus comes and says to you, &#x201C;Let not your heart be troubled&#x2026;&#x201D; (<a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outgoing/www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+14:1&apos;);\" href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+14:1\">John 14:1</a>).

Jesus doesn&#x2019;t bring anything up from the wells of human nature&#x2014; He brings them down from above. We limit the Holy One of Israel by remembering only what we have allowed Him to do for us in the past, and also by saying, &#x201C;Of course, I cannot expect God to do this particular thing.&#x201D; The thing that approaches the very limits of His power is the very thing we as disciples of Jesus ought to believe He will do. We impoverish and weaken His ministry in us the moment we forget He is almighty. The impoverishment is in us, not in Him. We will come to Jesus for Him to be our comforter or our sympathizer, but we refrain from approaching Him as our Almighty God.</p>\n<p>The reason some of us are such poor examples of Christianity is that we have failed to recognize that Christ is almighty. We have Christian attributes and experiences, but there is no abandonment or surrender to Jesus Christ.

Beware of sitting back, and saying, &#x201C;It can&#x2019;t be done.&#x201D; You will know it can be done if you will look to Jesus.

Many Christian workers have left Jesus Christ alone and yet tried to serve Him out of a sense of duty, or because they sense a need as a result of their own discernment.

If we do something simply out of a sense of duty, we are trying to live up to a standard that competes with Jesus Christ. We become a prideful, arrogant person, thinking we know what to do in every situation. We have put our sense of duty on the throne of our life, instead of enthroning the resurrection life of Jesus.

This friendship means being so intimately in touch with God that you never even need to ask Him to show you His will. It is evidence of a level of intimacy which confirms that you are nearing the final stage of your discipline in the life of faith. When you have a right-standing relationship with God, you have a life of freedom, liberty, and delight; you <em>are</em> God&#x2019;s will. And all of your commonsense decisions are actually His will for you, unless you sense a feeling of restraint brought on by a check in your spirit. You are free to make decisions in the light of a perfect and delightful friendship with God, knowing that if your decisions are wrong He will lovingly produce that sense of restraint. Once he does, you must stop immediately.</p>\n<p><strong>The Difficulties of His Friendship.</strong> Why did Abraham stop praying when he did? He stopped because he still was lacking the level of intimacy in his relationship with God, which would enable him boldly to continue on with the Lord in prayer until his desire was granted.

This will mean that all the other boundaries of life, whether they are mental, moral, or spiritual limits, are completely free with the freedom God gives His child; that is, a worshiping child, not a wayward one. A worker who lacks this serious controlling emphasis of concentration on God is apt to become overly burdened by his work. He is a slave to his own limits, having no freedom of his body, mind, or spirit. Consequently, he becomes burned out and defeated. There is no freedom and no delight in life at all. His nerves, mind, and heart are so overwhelmed that God&#x2019;s blessing cannot rest on him.</p>\n<p>But the opposite case is equally true&#x2013; once our concentration is on God, all the limits of our life are free and under the control and mastery of God alone. There is no longer any responsibility on you for the work. The only responsibility you have is to stay in living constant touch with God, and to see that you allow nothing to hinder your cooperation with Him. The freedom that comes after sanctification is the freedom of a child, and the things that used to hold your life down are gone.

There was only one bright-shining moment in the life of Jesus, and that was on the Mount of Transfiguration.

Criticism is one of the ordinary activities of people, but in the spiritual realm nothing is accomplished by it. The effect of criticism is the dividing up of the strengths of the one being criticized. The Holy Spirit is the only one in the proper position to criticize, and He alone is able to show what is wrong without hurting and wounding. It is impossible to enter into fellowship with God when you are in a critical mood. Criticism serves to make you harsh, vindictive, and cruel, and leaves you with the soothing and flattering idea that you are somehow superior to others. Jesus says that as His disciple you should cultivate a temperament that is never critical. This will not happen quickly but must be developed over a span of time. You must constantly beware of anything that causes you to think of yourself as a superior person.</p>\n<p>There is no escaping the penetrating search of my life by Jesus.

According to our thinking, everything is either delightful and good, or it is evil, malicious, and cowardly.</p>\n<p>Refusing to be disillusioned is the cause of much of the suffering of human life. And this is how that suffering happens&#x2014; if we love someone, but do not love God, we demand total perfection and righteousness from that person, and when we do not get it we become cruel and vindictive; yet we are demanding of a human being something which he or she cannot possibly give. There is only one Being who can completely satisfy to the absolute depth of the hurting human heart, and that is the Lord Jesus Christ. Our Lord is so obviously uncompromising with regard to every human relationship because He knows that every relationship that is not based on faithfulness to Himself will end in disaster. Our Lord trusted no one, and never placed His faith in people, yet He was never suspicious or bitter. Our Lord&#x2019;s confidence in God, and in what God&#x2019;s grace could do for anyone, was so perfect that He never despaired, never giving up hope for any person. If our trust is placed in human beings, we will end up despairing of everyone.</p>\n\t\t","scripture":{"address":"Psalms 51-53; Romans 2","url":"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=31&search=Psalms+51-53%3b+Romans+2"}},

No normal, healthy saint ever chooses suffering; he simply chooses God&#x2019;s will, just as Jesus did, whether it means suffering or not. And no saint should ever dare to interfere with the lesson of suffering being taught in another saint&#x2019;s life.</p>\n<p>The saint who satisfies the heart of Jesus will make other saints strong and mature for God. But the people used to strengthen us are never those who sympathize with us; in fact, we are hindered by those who give us their sympathy, because sympathy only serves to weaken us. No one better understands a saint than the saint who is as close and as intimate with Jesus as possible. If we accept the sympathy of another saint, our spontaneous feeling is, &#x201C;God is dealing too harshly with me and making my life too difficult.&#x201D; That is why Jesus said that self-pity was of the devil (see&#xA0;<a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&apos;/outgoing/www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+16:21-23&apos;);\" href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+16:21-23\">Matthew 16:21-23</a>). We must be merciful to God&#x2019;s reputation. It is easy for us to tarnish God&#x2019;s character because He never argues back; He never tries to defend or vindicate Himself.

If through your preaching you convince me that I am unholy, I then resent your preaching. The preaching of the gospel awakens an intense resentment because it is designed to reveal my unholiness, but it also awakens an intense yearning and desire within me. God has only one intended destiny for mankind&#x2014; holiness. His only goal is to produce saints. God is not some eternal blessing-machine for people to use, and He did not come to save us out of pity&#x2014; He came to save us because He created us to be holy.

The Spirit of God seizes me and I am compelled to get alone with God and fight the battle before Him. Until I do this, I will lose every time. The battle may take one minute or one year, but that will depend on me, not God. However long it takes, I must wrestle with it alone before God, and I must resolve to go through the hell of renunciation or rejection before Him. Nothing has any power over someone who has fought the battle before God and won there.</p>\n<p>I should never say, &#x201C;I will wait until I get into difficult circumstances and then I&#x2019;ll put God to the test.&#x201D; Trying to do that will not work. I must first get the issue settled between God and myself in the secret places of my soul, where no one else can interfere. Then I can go ahead, knowing with certainty that the battle is won. Lose it there, and calamity, disaster, and defeat before the world are as sure as the laws of God. The reason the battle is lost is that I fight it first in the external world. Get alone with God, do battle before Him, and settle the matter once and for all.</p>\n<p>In dealing with other people, our stance should always be to drive them toward making a decision of their will. That is how surrendering to God begins. Not often, but every once in a while, God brings us to a major turning point&#x2014; a great crossroads in our life. From that point we either go toward a more and more slow, lazy, and useless Christian life, or we become more and more on fire, giving our utmost for <em>His</em> highest&#x2014; our best for <em>His</em> glory.</p>\n\t\t","scripture":{"address":"Zechariah 1-4; Revelation 18","url":"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=31&search=Zechariah+1-4%3b+Revelation+18"}},

If we trust in our own abilities, instead of God&#x2019;s, we produce consequences for which God will hold us responsible. When God through His sovereignty brings us into new situations, we should immediately make sure that our natural life submits to the spiritual, obeying the orders of the Spirit of God. Just because we have responded properly in the past is no guarantee that we will do so again. The response of the natural to the spiritual should be continuous conversion, but this is where we so often refuse to be obedient. No matter what our situation is, the Spirit of God remains unchanged and His salvation unaltered.

God holds us accountable every time we refuse to convert ourselves, and He sees our refusal as willful disobedience. Our natural life must not rule&#x2014; God must rule in us.</p>\n<p>To refuse to be continuously converted puts a stumbling block in the growth of our spiritual life. There are areas of self-will in our lives where our pride pours contempt on the throne of God and says, &#x201C;I won&#x2019;t submit.&#x201D; We deify our independence and self-will and call them by the wrong name. What God sees as stubborn weakness, we call strength. There are whole areas of our lives that have not yet been brought into submission, and this can only be done by this continuous conversion. Slowly but surely we can claim the whole territory for the Spirit of God.</p>\n\t\t","scripture":{"address":"Zechariah 5-8; Revelation 19","url":"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=31&search=Zechariah+5-8%3b+Revelation+19"}},

If you do, a sense of property and personal right will emerge in you&#x2014; things on which Jesus placed no value.

But if a New Testament standard is revealed to us by the light of God, and we don&#x2019;t try to measure up, or even feel inclined to do so, then we begin to backslide. It means your conscience does not respond to the truth. You can never be the same after the unveiling of a truth.

In other words, see that your natural human life is putting on all that is in keeping with the new life. The life God places within us develops its own new virtues, not the virtues of the seed of Adam, but of Jesus Christ. Once God has begun the process of sanctification in your life, watch and see how God causes your confidence in your own natural virtues and power to wither away. He will continue until you learn to draw your life from the reservoir of the resurrection life of Jesus. Thank God if you are going through this drying-up experience!</p>\n<p>The sign that God is at work in us is that He is destroying our confidence in the natural virtues, because they are not promises of what we are going to be, but only a wasted reminder of what God created man to be. We want to cling to our natural virtues, while all the time God is trying to get us in contact with the life of Jesus Christ&#x2014; a life that can never be described in terms of natural virtues. It is the saddest thing to see people who are trying to serve God depending on that which the grace of God never gave them. They are depending solely on what they have by virtue of heredity. God does not take our natural virtues and transform them, because our natural virtues could never even come close to what Jesus Christ wants. No natural love, no natural patience, no natural purity can ever come up to His demands. But as we bring every part of our natural bodily life into harmony with the new life God has placed within us, He will exhibit in us the virtues that were characteristic of the Lord Jesus.</p>\n<p>And every virtue we possess<br>\nIs His alone.</p>\n\t\t","scripture":{"address":"Zechariah 13-14; Revelation 21","url":"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=31&search=Zechariah+13-14%3b+Revelation+21"}},

At the end of the year we turn with eagerness to all that God has for the future, and yet anxiety is apt to arise when we remember our yesterdays. Our present enjoyment of God&#x2019;s grace tends to be lessened by the memory of yesterday&#x2019;s sins and blunders.
